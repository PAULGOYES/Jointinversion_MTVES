This repository contains the official implementation of the method presented in the paper *"Physics-Guided Deep Learning for Joint Inversion of DC-Resistivity and Magnetotelluric Data"*. The framework integrates differentiable forward models for VES and MT data into an unsupervised deep learning architecture, enabling the recovery of 1D resistivity models without labeled data or initial models.

The code includes all components to reproduce the three experiments presented in the article:

- **Experiment I**: Sensitivity analysis of the joint inversion weight.  
- **Experiment II**: Robustness under epistemic uncertainty.  
- **Experiment III**: Application to field data and comparison with conventional methods.

> **Note:** The Jupyter notebooks in this repository require **TensorFlow 2.19.0** for correct execution.
